Development Workflows
=====================

Information about LibreClinca development and contribution workflows.

Version Control
---------------

Git version control system is used for tracking changes in LibreClinica project repositories. Those are hosted publicly via `ReliaTec GmbH GitHub <https://github.com/reliatec-gmbh/>`_ organisation. 

Repository
----------

`LibreClinica <https://github.com/reliatec-gmbh/LibreClinica>`_ (origin) repository was created as a fork from `OpenClinica <https://github.com/OpenClinica/OpenClinica>`_ (upstream) public repository. Certain naming conventions are defined in order to prevent naming collisions (for versions, branches and tags).

Issue Management
----------------

GitHub integrated issues management should be used to creates tickets before any code contributions. Tickets assigned to milestones that reflect the LibreClinica software versioning scheme. For each version an appropriate Kanban board is defined to track the progress of development activities.

Main Branches
-------------

Source code organisation is inspired by Vincent Driessen `git branching model <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>`_ that promotes two main branches with an infinite lifetime (master and lc-develop).

master
^^^^^^

This branch represents the production ready state of code. No direct commits are permitted to the master. Only merges from supporting branches (release or hotfix) are allowed. Every changes merged back into master repository is considered as new release (that shell be tagged). The initial state of master is cloned from the release branch of upstream repository (3.14).

lc-develop
^^^^^^^^^^

This is a new default branch for origin repository. It tracks development changes for the next software release. This branch should be used for the purpose of continuous integration. Changes to lc-develop are introduced by merges from supporting branches (feature, release or hotfix).

Supporting Branches
-------------------

Additional temporal branches are created from lc-develop or master in order to introduce changes to the source code.

feature branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

===========  ==========  =================
Branch from  Merge into  Naming convention
===========  ==========  =================
lc-develop   lc-develop  anything except master, lc-develop, lc-release-\*, lc-hotfix-\*
===========  ==========  =================

   $ git checkout -b myfeature lc-develop


.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Merging a feature branch on lc-develop

   $ git checkout lc-develop
   $ git merge --no-ff myfeature
   $ git branch -d myfeature
   $ git push origin lc-develop

release branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

===========  ========================  =================
Branch from  Merge into                Naming convention
===========  ========================  =================
lc-develop   lc-develop and master     lc-release-\*
===========  ========================  =================

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Creating a release branch from lc-develop

   $ git checkout -b lc-release-1.3.0 lc-develop
   $ ./bump-version.sh 1.3.0
   $ git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.3.0"

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Merging a release branch on master and tagging

   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge --no-ff lc-release-1.3.0
   $ git tag -a lc-1.3.0

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Merging a release branch on lc-develop

   $ git checkout lc-develop
   $ git merge --no-ff lc-release-1.3.0

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Removing a temporary release branch

   $ git branch -d lc-release-1.3.0

hotfix branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

===========  ========================  =================
Branch from  Merge into                Naming convention
===========  ========================  =================
master       lc-develop and master     lc-hotfix-\*
===========  ========================  =================

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Creating a hotfix branch from master

   $ git checkout -b lc-hotfix-1.3.1 master
   $ ./bump-version.sh 1.3.1
   $ git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.3.1"

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Fix the bug and commit the fix

   $ git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Merging a hotfix branch on master and tagging

   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge --no-ff lc-hotfix-1.3.1
   $ git tag -a lc-1.3.1

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Merging a hotfix branch on lc-develop

   $ git checkout lc-develop
   $ git merge --no-ff lc-hotfix-1.3.1


.. note::  The one exception to the rule here is that, when a release branch currently exists, the hotfix changes need to be merged into that release branch, instead of develop.

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Removing a temporary hotfix branch

   $ git branch -d lc-hotfix-1.3.1

Tags
----

Tags should be created for released LibreClinica versions.

Release Versioning
------------------

There is a need to start with fresh versioning scheme for LibreClinica (independent from upstream) to allow independent release cycle.

* MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Database scheme versioning is currently unchanged. Up until now there have not been changes in DB scheme introduced in LibreClinica since the time of fork.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions resolving registered tickets are submitted from personal forks of developers as pull requests. If the contribution is targeting a registered bug ticket, this bug need to be described (ideally using defined bug report template) in a reproducible manner and reproduced by somebody else from the team of contributors. For new features the appropriate test specification need to be submitted fitting the numeric scheme used for test documentation (this should be ideally clarified with the main contributor team before).
